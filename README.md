### 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project 

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates the end-to-end journey of building a modern data warehouse and delivering actionable insights through analytics. It is designed as a portfolio project to showcase industry best practices in Data Engineering, Data Modeling, and Analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for structured and scalable data processing:

Bronze Layer – Raw data storage (as-is) ingested from ERP and CRM CSV files into SQL Server Database.

Silver Layer – Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization for consistency and quality.

Gold Layer – Business-ready Star Schema models designed for reporting and analytics.

📖 Project Overview

This project covers the full lifecycle of a data warehouse:

Data Architecture → Designing a modern DWH using Medallion Architecture.

ETL Pipelines → Extract, transform, and load (CSV → SQL Server) with focus on quality and integrity.

Data Modeling → Building Fact & Dimension tables optimized for analytics.

Analytics & Reporting → Writing SQL-based reports and building dashboards to generate business insights.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

✅ SQL Development – writing complex queries for ETL & analytics.

✅ Data Engineering – designing pipelines and workflows.

✅ Data Modeling – creating star schemas and dimensional models.

✅ ETL Pipeline Development – transforming raw data into business-ready insights.

✅ Data Analytics – delivering reports on customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

✅ Data Architecture – implementing Medallion Architecture for scalable DWH design.
